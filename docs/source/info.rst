GeViewer has been developed and tested using a limited number of Geant4
detector geometries, so the HepRep and VRML parsing functionalities are
not yet exhaustive. If you find that a particular geometry or component
is not being parsed correctly, please `open an
issue <https://github.com/clarkehardy/geviewer/issues>`__ on the GitHub
repository and provide the file snippet in question, or fix the issue
yourself and submit a pull request. Other suggestions, feature requests,
or improvements are also welcome.
